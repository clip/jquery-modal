## Quick start
	
### JavaScript

    <div class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
            
            <!-- content -->
            
        </div>
        <span class="modal-close">close X</span>
    </div>

## DOCS

### Overview
This was written to address some issues I've experienced when working with a number of existing modal plugins:
		
* It dynamically sizes the modal based on it's final state, so any styles applied based on .modal * will be taken into account and the modal correctly sized.
* It avoids the use of fixed positioning to ensure users can always get to the content, even if it's out of the viewport.
* It allows extra classes to be added to the container element (not just the content element) to easily change and extend different 'skins'.

### Options

#### width: 'auto' (string, number)
Defines the width of the modal, if set to 'auto' the width will be automatically calculated based on size of content

#### height: 'auto' (string, number)

#### maxWidth: 600 (number)
Defines the maxium width of the modal

#### maxHeight: 600 (number)
Defines the maxium height of the modal

#### fitViewport: true (boolean)

#### keepAspect: false (boolean)

#### modal: true (boolean)
If set to true the page will blocked with an overlay div to stop interaction

#### openSpeed: 'fast' (string, number)
